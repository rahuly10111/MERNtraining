-->> A controller is a module or class that handles requests and responses for a specific part of a web application. It typically contains methods that correspond to different HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL paths. When a request matches the path and verb of a method in a controller, that method is called to generate a response.

-->> A router is a module or class that maps URL paths to controllers and their methods. It allows you to organize your application's routes into separate modules or files, making it easier to manage and maintain.

-->> Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js and Deno (alpha).

-->> MongoClient is a class in the MongoDB Node.js driver that allows us to connect to a MongoDB database instance and perform various operations on it. It provides a simple API to connect to a MongoDB server, and the client instance can be used to interact with the server, such as inserting, updating, and querying data. It is the starting point for most interactions with MongoDB.

-->> Prisma migration is a tool for managing schema changes in a structured and safe way, while Prisma db push is a tool for quickly applying schema changes directly to your database during development.
